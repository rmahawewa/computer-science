Normally in recursive methods the same methord calls inside the particular method.

Example: Fibonacchi numbers generation
- A fibonacci number generates by adding the previous two fibonacci numbers together
-First fibonacci number is - 0
-Second fibonacci number is - 1
-By adding these two numbers, we can create the third fibonacci number - 0 + 1 = 1
-Then by adding second and third fibonacci numbers we can create the forth fibonacci number - 1 + 1 = 2
-Next by adding third and forth fibonacci numbers we can create fifth fibonacci number - 1 + 2 = 3
-Then the sixth fibonacci number generates - 2 + 3 = 5
-Seventh fibonacci number is - 3 + 5 = 8

So we can write the first few numbers in the fibonacci serice as : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

We can programatically implement the fibonacci series using Recursion

function generate_fibonacci_numbers(fib1, fib2){
    if(fib1 === 0 && fib2 === 0){
        fib1 = 0;
        fib2 = 1;
    }

    fib3 = fib1 + fib2;
    fib1 = fib2;
    fib2 = fib3;

    while (fib3 <= 34){
        generate_fibonacci_numbers(fib1, fib2);
    }

    return fib3;
}
